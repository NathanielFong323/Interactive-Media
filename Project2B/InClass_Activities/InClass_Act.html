    <p><b>- Week 04: NGV Visit</b><br> 
        We visited Yayoi Kusama's exhibition at the NGV, she often illustrateswith  lines and circles, creating many stunning artworks. <br> Below are some of the artworks that Iadmire.</p>

    <p>
        Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring Yayoi Kusama's work at the NGV. Her distinctive use of circlesand   irregular lines creates <br>a stunning visuals that oddly promotes geometric harmony, where chaosand order   coexist. This exhibition greatly inspired me to <br>incorporatecircles and lines into myinteractive designs,     creating geometric beauties.</p>

    <p><b>- Week 05: Slave To The algorithm</b><br> 
        Some of my activities are to be decided by a flip of the coin, this includes:<br>
        / Take the tram or the train<br>
        / To wear jeans or sport pants<br>
        / To wear shorts or long sleeves<br>
        / To wear black or white<br>
        / Drink water or tea<br>
        Here are some of the results:<br></p>

        I really enjoyed these activities, as they offered a fresh perspective of how we live our daily lives. In our digital age determined <br>by algorithm, this experience allowed me to experience the paradoxical nature of how restrictive algorithm can feel, while <br>simultaneously providing millions of different possibilites.</p>

    <p><b>- Week 05: Kusama inspired P5 sketch</b><br>
        Using P5.js, I draw a potrait inspired by Kusama's stunning works. Her work often portrays circle in monochromic color, but as I <br>want to add my own elemet into the portrait, I only left the face in simple color, but drew my hair and body with numerous circles >br>of different bright colors</p>

    <p><b>- Week 06: Sorting</b><br>
         We attempted to learn the power of sorting through a simple exercise where we have to sort our own belongings. For our group, <br>we decided to sort by "How effective it is as a self-defense weapon". We decided that a metalic water bottle would be the best, <br>followed by heavy laptops, then sharp pens and keys.</p>

    <p>
        From this, I have learnt the strength in creative sorting. As different criteria of sorting can lead to infinite combination, ordering <br>and grouping, breathing fresh new ideas to a pre-existing group of entities. While I ultimately did not utilize sorting in my final work, <br>I still find this exercise to be extremely insightful, as it allows me to think outside of the box, and come up with different method <br>of using a pre-existing techniques.</p>
